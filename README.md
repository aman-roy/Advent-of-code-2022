# Advent of Code 2022

This repository has all the implementation of my code for AoC-2022. The code is not written for readability and maintainability as the nature of the contest dictates. 

I am using AOCD authored by [Wim glenn](https://github.com/wimglenn) for fetching the input. You need to configure it before running my code by setting the token. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data#quickstart). 
```
pip install advent-of-code-data
```
